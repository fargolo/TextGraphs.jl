### To do:  

When sampling random graphs, take the z-score instead of raw ratio respective to the average

---

Recurrence based on string distances

---

Find a transformation for centrality and connectivity that scales linearly with length of graph.
For det(X), log(det(x)) worked.

---

Add multiple edges for repeated recurrences. 

---

Remove stopwords when analyzing semantic distances.
